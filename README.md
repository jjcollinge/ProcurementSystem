# ProcurementSystem
The primary objective of this application is to enable site managers to control their procurement of goods directly and independently, without the industry common practice of being reliant upon office based staff to make orders, which can result in "lost in translation" issues. Currently, a site manager manages the demand for the goods required on his site from suppliers by using a mobile phone to initiate the chain of events that result in the creation of a purchase order. This normally means that a third party from the procurement department of the construction company has to raise the actual purchase order for the site manager.
